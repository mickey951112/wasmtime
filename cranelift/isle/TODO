- Optimizations
  - Infallible patterns; optimize away control flow when possible.
  - Don't do the closure-wrapping thing for expressions inside of patterns.

- Document semantics carefully, especially wrt extractors.

- Build out an initial set of bindings for Cranelift LowerCtx with extractors
  for instruction info.
