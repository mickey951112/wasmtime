This crate contains a library that enables
[Cranelift](https://crates.io/crates/cranelift)
to emit native object (".o") files, using the
[Faerie](https://crates.io/crates/faerie) library.

DEPRECATION NOTICE: the Cranelift developer team intends to stop maintaining
the `cranelift-faerie` crate and remove it from the `wasmtime` git repository
on or after August 3, 2020. We recommend users use its successor, the
`cranelift-object` crate.
