# Linux

* path_rename_trailing_slashes
    - trailing slash behavior of files is wrong: trailing slashes are ignored,
      should cause an error.
* remove_directory_trailing_slashes
    - cap-std Dir::remove_dir gives EINVAL when trying to remove dir with
      trailing slash. otherwise, everything passes.
* path_filestat
    - symlink mtim doesnt match expectations


# Windows

* fd_readdir
    - DirEntry metadata ino panics on windows: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/issues/142
* file_allocate
    - call to fd_allocate(10,10) reduces size from 100 to 20
    - fix upstream: fd_allocate is impossible on windows, so dont even try
    - the test should be modified to accept this fd_allocate always failing on windows.
* nofollow_errors
    - I loosened up some errno acceptance but windows requires rmdir to delete
      a symlink to a directory, rather than unlink_file
* symlink_create
    - narrowed down the symlink delete issue that only shows up on linux
* path_rename
    - permission denied on windows to rename a dir to an existing empty dir
    - we're not going to try to emulate this functionality.
    - the test should be modified accept this operation failing completely on windows.
* path_link
    - fails on the first dangling symlink
* fd_flags_set
    - same metadata panic as fd_readdir
* path_filestat
    - same metadata panic as fd_readdir
