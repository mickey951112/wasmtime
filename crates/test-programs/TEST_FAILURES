# Linux

* path_rename_file_trailing_slashes
    - trailing slash behavior of files is wrong: trailing slashes are ignored,
      should cause an error.
* remove_directory_trailing_slashes
    - cap-std Dir::remove_dir gives EINVAL when trying to remove dir with
      trailing slash. otherwise, everything passes.


# Windows

* fd_readdir
    - DirEntry metadata ino panics on windows: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/issues/142
* nofollow_errors
    - I loosened up some errno acceptance but windows requires rmdir to delete
      a symlink to a directory, rather than unlink_file
    - fix merged in next cap-std release
* symlink_create
    - narrowed down the symlink delete issue that only shows up on linux
    - dan is doing the upstream fix rn
* fd_flags_set
    - same metadata panic as fd_readdir
* path_filestat
    - same metadata panic as fd_readdir


## "Trailing slashes are a bonified boondoggle" - Dan

* interesting_paths
    - on windows, opening a directory with a trailing slash fails.
* path_rename_file_trailing_slashes
    - same incorrect behavior as linux


* dangling_fd
* dangling_symlink
