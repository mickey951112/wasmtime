//
// Note that this is an `unsafe` trait as `TypedFunc`'s safety heavily relies on
// the correctness of the implementations of this trait. Some ways in which this
// trait must be correct to be safe are:
//
// * The `Lower` associated type must be a `ValRaw` sequence. It doesn't have to
//   literally be `[ValRaw; N]` but when laid out in memory it must be adjacent
//   `ValRaw` values and have a multiple of the size of `ValRaw` and the same
//   alignment.
//
// * The `lower` function must initialize the bits within `Lower` that are going
//   to be read by the trampoline that's used to enter core wasm. A trampoline
//   is passed `*mut Lower` and will read the canonical abi arguments in
//   sequence, so all of the bits must be correctly initialized.
//
// * The `size` and `align` functions must be correct for this value stored in
//   the canonical ABI. The `Cursor<T>` iteration of these bytes rely on this
//   for correctness as they otherwise eschew bounds-checking.
//
// There are likely some other correctness issues which aren't documented as
// well, this isn't intended to be an exhaustive list. It suffices to say,
// though, that correctness bugs in this trait implementation are highly likely
// to lead to security bugs, which again leads to the `unsafe` in the trait.
//
