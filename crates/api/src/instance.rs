/// you can access the [`exports`](Instance::exports) which are of type
/// [`Extern`] and provide the ability to call functions, set globals, read
/// memory, etc. This is where all the fun stuff happens!
///
/// An [`Instance`] is created from two inputs, a [`Module`] and a list of
/// imports, provided as a list of [`Extern`] values. The [`Module`] is the wasm
/// code that was compiled and we're instantiating, and the [`Extern`] imports
/// are how we're satisfying the imports of the module provided. On successful
/// instantiation an [`Instance`] will automatically invoke the wasm `start`
/// function.
///
/// When interacting with any wasm code you'll want to make an [`Instance`] to
/// call any code or execute anything!

    /// following the procedure in the [core specification][inst] to
    /// instantiate. Instantiation can fail for a number of reasons (many
    /// specified below), but if successful the `start` function will be
    /// automatically run (if provided) and then the [`Instance`] will be
    /// returned.
    ///
    /// ## Providing Imports
    ///
    /// The `imports` array here is a bit tricky. The entries in the list of
    /// `imports` are intended to correspond 1:1 with the list of imports
    /// returned by [`Module::imports`]. Before calling [`Instance::new`] you'll
    /// want to inspect the return value of [`Module::imports`] and, for each
    /// import type, create an [`Extern`] which corresponds to that type.
    /// These [`Extern`] values are all then collected into a list and passed to
    /// this function.
    ///
    /// Note that this function is intentionally relatively low level. It is the
    /// intention that we'll soon provide a [higher level API][issue] which will
    /// be much more ergonomic for instantiating modules. If you need the full
    /// power of customization of imports, though, this is the method for you!
    ///
    /// ## Errors
    ///
    /// This function can fail for a number of reasons, including, but not
    /// limited to:
    ///
    /// * The number of `imports` provided doesn't match the number of imports
    ///   returned by the `module`'s [`Module::imports`] method.
    /// * The type of any [`Extern`] doesn't match the corresponding
    ///   [`ExternType`] entry that it maps to.
    /// * The `start` function in the instance, if present, traps.
    /// * Module/instance resource limits are exceeded.
    ///
    /// When instantiation fails it's recommended to inspect the return value to
    /// see why it failed, or bubble it upwards. If you'd like to specifically
    /// check for trap errors, you can use `error.downcast::<Trap>()`.
