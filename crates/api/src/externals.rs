///
/// # `Memory` and threads
///
/// It is intended that `Memory` is safe to share between threads. At this time
/// this is not implemented in `wasmtime`, however. This is planned to be
/// implemented though!
///
/// # `Memory` and Safety
///
/// Linear memory is a lynchpin of safety for WebAssembly, but it turns out
/// there are very few ways to safely inspect the contents of a memory from the
/// host (Rust). This is because memory safety is quite tricky when working with
/// a `Memory` and we're still working out the best idioms to encapsulate
/// everything safely where it's efficient and ergonomic. This section of
/// documentation, however, is intended to help educate a bit what is and isn't
/// safe when working with `Memory`.
///
/// For safety purposes you can think of a `Memory` as a glorified
/// `Rc<UnsafeCell<Vec<u8>>>`. There are a few consequences of this
/// interpretation:
///
/// * At any time someone else may have access to the memory (hence the `Rc`).
///   This could be a wasm instance, other host code, or a set of wasm instances
///   which all reference a `Memory`. When in doubt assume someone else has a
///   handle to your `Memory`.
///
/// * At any time, memory can be read from or written to (hence the
///   `UnsafeCell`). Anyone with a handle to a wasm memory can read/write to it.
///   Primarily other instances can execute the `load` and `store` family of
///   instructions, as well as any other which modifies or reads memory.
///
/// * At any time memory may grow (hence the `Vec<..>`). Growth may relocate the
///   base memory pointer (similar to how `vec.push(...)` can change the result
///   of `.as_ptr()`)
///
/// So given that we're working roughly with `Rc<UnsafeCell<Vec<u8>>>` that's a
/// lot to keep in mind! It's hopefully though sort of setting the stage as to
/// what you can safely do with memories.
///
/// Let's run through a few safe examples first of how you can use a `Memory`.
///
/// ```rust
/// use wasmtime::Memory;
///
/// fn safe_examples(mem: &Memory) {
///     // Just like wasm, it's safe to read memory almost at any time. The
///     // gotcha here is that we need to be sure to load from the correct base
///     // pointer and perform the bounds check correctly. So long as this is
///     // all self contained here (e.g. not arbitrary code in the middle) we're
///     // good to go.
///     let byte = unsafe { mem.data_unchecked()[0x123] };
///
///     // Short-lived borrows of memory are safe, but they must be scoped and
///     // not have code which modifies/etc `Memory` while the borrow is active.
///     // For example if you want to read a string from memory it is safe to do
///     // so:
///     let string_base = 0xdead;
///     let string_len = 0xbeef;
///     let string = unsafe {
///         let bytes = &mem.data_unchecked()[string_base..][..string_len];
///         match std::str::from_utf8(bytes) {
///             Ok(s) => s.to_string(), // copy out of wasm memory
///             Err(_) => panic!("not valid utf-8"),
///         }
///     };
///
///     // Additionally like wasm you can write to memory at any point in time,
///     // again making sure that after you get the unchecked slice you don't
///     // execute code which could read/write/modify `Memory`:
///     unsafe {
///         mem.data_unchecked_mut()[0x123] = 3;
///     }
///
///     // When working with *borrows* that point directly into wasm memory you
///     // need to be extremely careful. Any functionality that operates on a
///     // borrow into wasm memory needs to be thoroughly audited to effectively
///     // not touch the `Memory` at all
///     let data_base = 0xfeed;
///     let data_len = 0xface;
///     unsafe {
///         let data = &mem.data_unchecked()[data_base..][..data_len];
///         host_function_that_doesnt_touch_memory(data);
///
///         // effectively the same rules apply to mutable borrows

/// unsafe fn unsafe_examples(mem: &Memory) -> Result<()> {
///     // First and foremost, any borrow can be invalidated at any time via the
///     // `Memory::grow` function. This can relocate memory which causes any
///     // previous pointer to be possibly invalid now.
///     let pointer: &u8 = &mem.data_unchecked()[0x100];
///     mem.grow(1)?; // invalidates `pointer`!
///     // println!("{}", *pointer); // FATAL: use-after-free
///
///     // Note that the use-after-free also applies to slices, whether they're
///     // slices of bytes or strings.
///     let slice: &[u8] = &mem.data_unchecked()[0x100..0x102];
///     mem.grow(1)?; // invalidates `slice`!
///     // println!("{:?}", slice); // FATAL: use-after-free
///
///     // Due to the reference-counted nature of `Memory` note that literal
///     // calls to `Memory::grow` are not sufficient to audit for. You'll need
///     // to be careful that any mutation of `Memory` doesn't happen while
///     // you're holding an active borrow.
///     let slice: &[u8] = &mem.data_unchecked()[0x100..0x102];
///     some_other_function(); // may invalidate `slice` through another `mem` reference
///     // println!("{:?}", slice); // FATAL: maybe a use-after-free
///
///     // An especially subtle aspect of accessing a wasm instance's memory is
///     // that you need to be extremely careful about aliasing. Anyone at any
///     // time can call `data_unchecked()` or `data_unchecked_mut()`, which
///     // means you can easily have aliasing mutable references:
///     let ref1: &u8 = &mem.data_unchecked()[0x100];
///     let ref2: &mut u8 = &mut mem.data_unchecked_mut()[0x100];
///     // *ref2 = *ref1; // FATAL: violates Rust's aliasing rules
///
///     // Note that aliasing applies to strings as well, for example this is
///     // not valid because the slices overlap.
///     let slice1: &mut [u8] = &mut mem.data_unchecked_mut()[0x100..][..3];
///     let slice2: &mut [u8] = &mut mem.data_unchecked_mut()[0x102..][..4];
///     // println!("{:?} {:?}", slice1, slice2); // FATAL: aliasing mutable pointers
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// # fn some_other_function() {}
/// ```
///
/// Overall there's some general rules of thumb when working with `Memory` and
/// getting raw pointers inside of it:
///
/// * If you never have a "long lived" pointer into memory, you're likely in the
///   clear. Care still needs to be taken in threaded scenarios or when/where
///   data is read, but you'll be shielded from many classes of issues.
/// * Long-lived pointers must always respect Rust'a aliasing rules. It's ok for
///   shared borrows to overlap with each other, but mutable borrows must
///   overlap with nothing.
/// * Long-lived pointers are only valid if `Memory` isn't used in an unsafe way
///   while the pointer is valid. This includes both aliasing and growth.
///
/// At this point it's worth reiterating again that working with `Memory` is
/// pretty tricky and that's not great! Proposals such as [interface types] are
/// intended to prevent wasm modules from even needing to import/export memory
/// in the first place, which obviates the need for all of these safety caveats!
/// Additionally over time we're still working out the best idioms to expose in
/// `wasmtime`, so if you've got ideas or questions please feel free to [open an
/// issue]!
///
/// ## `Memory` Safety and Threads
///
/// Currently the `wasmtime` crate does not implement the wasm threads proposal,
/// but it is planned to do so. It's additionally worthwhile discussing how this
/// affects memory safety and what was previously just discussed as well.
///
/// Once threads are added into the mix, all of the above rules still apply.
/// There's an additional, rule, however, that all reads and writes can
/// happen *concurrently*. This effectively means that long-lived borrows into
/// wasm memory are virtually never safe to have.
///
/// Mutable pointers are fundamentally unsafe to have in a concurrent scenario
/// in the face of arbitrary wasm code. Only if you dynamically know for sure
/// that wasm won't access a region would it be safe to construct a mutable
/// pointer. Additionally even shared pointers are largely unsafe because their
/// underlying contents may change, so unless `UnsafeCell` in one form or
/// another is used everywhere there's no safety.
///
/// One important point about concurrency is that `Memory::grow` can indeed
/// happen concurrently. This, however, will never relocate the base pointer.
/// Shared memories must always have a maximum size and they will be
/// preallocated such that growth will never relocate the base pointer. The
/// maximum length of the memory, however, will change over time.
///
/// Overall the general rule of thumb for shared memories is that you must
/// atomically read and write everything. Nothing can be borrowed and everything
/// must be eagerly copied out.
