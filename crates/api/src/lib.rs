//! Wasmtime's embedding API
//!
//! This crate contains a high-level API used to interact with WebAssembly
//! modules. The API here is intended to mirror the proposed [WebAssembly C
//! API](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), with small extensions here
//! and there to implement Rust idioms. This crate also defines the actual C API
//! itself for consumption from other languages.
