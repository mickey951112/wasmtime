[features]
# These features have no effect on the users of this crate. They are only
# necessary for testing.
# The wiggle proc-macro emits some code (inside `pub mod metadata`) guarded
# by the `wiggle_metadata` feature flag. We use this feature flag so that
# users of wiggle are not forced to take a direct dependency on the `witx`
# crate unless they want it.
wiggle_metadata = ["wiggle-runtime/wiggle_metadata"]
# In order to test that the contents of this metadata module meet
# expectations, we must have this feature enabled for the crate by default.
default = ["wiggle_metadata"]
