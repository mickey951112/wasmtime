///! # Wasmtime's WASI Preview 2 Implementation
///!
///! Welcome to the (new!) WASI implementation from the Wasmtime team. The goal
///! of this implementation is to support WASI Preview 2 via the Component
///! Model, as well as to provide legacy Preview 1 host support with an adapter
///! that is implemented in terms of the Preview 2 interfaces.
///!
///! Presently, this crate is experimental. We don't yet recommend you use it
///! in production. Specifically:
///! * it does not yet support a synchronous rust embedding
///! * polling and streams need a redesign. IO that currently shoudl be
///! non-blocking may be blocking. poll probably doesnt work at all.
///! * its internal organization could use some love
///! * the Preview 1 host support is in its infancy
///! * the wit files in tree describing preview 2 are not faithful to the
///! standards repos
///!
///! Once these issues are resolved, we expect to move this namespace up to the
///! root of the wasmtime-wasi crate, and move its other exports underneath a
///! `pub mod legacy` with an off-by-default feature flag, and after 2
///! releases, retire and remove that code from our tree.
