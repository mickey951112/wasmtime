// General runtime type-information about a component.
//
// ## Optimizing instantiation
//
// One major consideration for the structure of the types in this module is to
// make instantiation as fast as possible. To facilitate this the representation
// here avoids the need to create a `PrimaryMap` during instantiation of a
// component for each index space like the func, global, table, etc, index
// spaces. Instead a component is simply defined by a list of instantiation
// instructions, and arguments to the instantiation of each instance are a list
// of "pointers" into previously created instances. This means that we only need
// to build up one list of instances during instantiation.
//
// Additionally we also try to avoid string lookups wherever possible. In the
// component model instantiation and aliasing theoretically deals with lots of
// string lookups here and there. This is slower than indexing lookup, though,
// and not actually necessary when the structure of a module is statically
// known. This means that `ExportItem` below has two variants where we try to
// use the indexing variant as much as possible, which can be done for
// everything except imported core wasm modules.
