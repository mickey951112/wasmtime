This directory contains the necessary parts for building a library with FFI
access to the Wasm spec interpreter. Its major parts:
 - `spec`: the Wasm spec code as a Git submodule (you may need to retrieve it:
   `git clone https://github.com/conrad-watt/spec/tree/wasmtime_fuzzing).
 - `interpret.ml`: a shim layer for calling the Wasm spec code and exposing it
   for FFI access
 - `Makefile`: the steps for gluing these pieces together into a static library

Note: the makefile must be configured with the path to libgmp. See LIBGMP_PATHS
in the makefile.
