# WASI tutorial

Let's start with a simple C program which performs a file copy, which will
show to compile and run programs, as well as perform simple sandbox
configuration. The C code here uses standard POSIX APIs, and doesn't have
any knowledge of WASI, WebAssembly, or sandboxing.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <errno.h>

int
main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int n, m;
    char buf[BUFSIZ];

    if (argc != 3) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <from> <to>\n", argv[0]);
        exit(1);
    }

    int in = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
    if (in < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "error opening input %s: %s\n", argv[1], strerror(errno));
        exit(1);
    }

    int out = open(argv[2], O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0660);
    if (out < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "error opening output %s: %s\n", argv[2], strerror(errno));
        exit(1);
    }

    while ((n = read(in, buf, BUFSIZ)) > 0) {
        while (n > 0) {
            m = write(out, buf, n);
            if (m < 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "write error: %s\n", strerror(errno));
                exit(1);
            }
            n -= m;
        }
    }

    if (n < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "read error: %s\n", strerror(errno));
        exit(1);
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

We'll put this source in a file called `demo.c`.

The [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/CraneStation/wasi-sdk/releases) provides a clang
which is configured to target WASI and use the WASI sysroot by default, so we can
compile our program like so:

```
$ clang demo.c
```

A few things to note here. First, this is just regular clang, configured to use
a WebAssembly target and sysroot. The name `a.out` is the traditional default
output name that C compilers use, and can be overridden with the "-o" flag in the
usual way. And, the output of clang here is a standard WebAssembly module:

```
$ file a.out
a.out: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
```

It's a single file containing a self-contained wasm module, that doesn't require
any supporting JS code.

We can execute it with wasmtime directly, like so:

```
$ wasmtime a.out
usage: a.out <from> <to>
```

Ok, this program needs some command-line arguments. So let's give it some:

```
$ echo hello world > test.txt
$ wasmtime a.out test.txt /tmp/somewhere.txt
error opening input test.txt: Capabilities insufficient
```

Aha, now we're seeing the sandboxing in action. This program is attempting to
access a file by the name of `test.txt`, however it hasn't been given the
capability to do so.

So let's give it capabilities to access files in the requisite directories:

```
$ wasmtime --dir=. --dir=/tmp a.out test.txt /tmp/somewhere.txt
$ cat /tmp/somewhere.txt
hello world
```

Now our program runs as expected!

As a brief aside, note that we used the path `.` above to grant the program
access to the current directory. This is needed because the mapping from
paths to associated capabilities is performed by libc, so it's part of the
WebAssembly program, and we don't expose the actual current working
directory to the WebAssembly program. So providing a full path doesn't work:

```
$ wasmtime --dir=$PWD --dir=/tmp a.out test.txt /tmp/somewhere.txt
$ cat /tmp/somewhere.txt
error opening input test.txt: Capabilities insufficient
```

So, we always have to use `.` to refer to the current directory.

Speaking of `.`, what about `..`? Does that give programs a way to break
out of the sandbox? Let's see:

```
$ wasmtime --dir=. --dir=/tmp a.out test.txt /tmp/../etc/passwd
$ cat /tmp/somewhere.txt
error opening output /tmp/../etc/passwd: Capabilities insufficient
```

The sandbox says no. And note that this is the capabilities system saying no
here ("Capabilities insufficient"), rather than Unix access controls
("Permission denied"). Even if the user running wasmtime had write access to
`/etc/passwd`, WASI programs don't have the capability to access files outside
of the directories they've been granted. This is true when resolving symbolic
links as well.

Wasmtime also has the ability to remap directories, with the `--mapdir`
command-line option:

```
$ wasmtime --dir=. --mapdir=/tmp:/var/tmp a.out test.txt /tmp/somewhere.txt
$ cat /var/tmp/somewhere.txt
hello world
```

This maps the name `/tmp` within the WebAssembly program to `/var/tmp` in the
host filesystem. So the WebAssembly program itself never sees the `/var/tmp` path,
but that's where the output file goes.

See [here](WASI-capabilities.md) for more information on the capability-based
security model.

The capability model is very powerful, and what's shown here is just the beginning.
In the future, we'll be exposing much more functionality, including finer-grained
capabilities, capabilities for network ports, and the ability for applications to
explicitly request capabilities.
