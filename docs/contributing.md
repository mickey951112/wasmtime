# Contributing

We're excited to work on Wasmtime together with you! This guide should help you
get up and running with Wasmtime development. But first, make sure you've read
the [Code of Conduct](./contributing-coc.html)!

## Join Our Chat

We chat about Wasmtime development on Zulip &mdash; [join
us!](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime)

If you're having trouble building Wasmtime, aren't sure why a test is failing,
or have any other questions, feel free to ask here. You can also [open an
issue](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/new)!

## Finding Something to Hack On

If you're looking for something to do, these are great places to start:

* [Issues labeled "good first
  issue"](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  &mdash; these issues tend to be simple, what needs to be done is well known,
  and are good for new contributors to tackle. The goal is to learn Wasmtime's
  development workflow and make sure that you can build and test Wasmtime.

* [Issues labeled "help
  wanted"](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/help%20wanted)
  &mdash; these are issues that we need a little help with!

If you're unsure if an issue is a good fit for you or not, feel free to ask in a
comment on the issue, or in chat.
