Thanks for opening a bug report! Please answer the questions below
if they're relevant and delete this text before submitting.

- What are the steps to reproduce the issue? Can you include a CLIF test case,
  ideally reduced with the `bugpoint` clif-util command?
- What do you expect to happen? What does actually happen? Does it panic, and
  if so, with which assertion?
- Which Cranelift version / commit hash / branch are you using?
- If relevant, can you include some extra information about your environment?
  (Rust version, operating system, architecture...)
