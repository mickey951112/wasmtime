# The purpose of this workflow is to, once a month, trigger Wasmtime's release
# process. All that actually happens here is that whenever this is triggered it
# will send a PR to the main repository with the version numbers automatically
# bumped. The next stage of the process is to simply merge the PR, and the
# `push-tag.yml` process takes over from there.
#
# Note that this creates a commit and a PR with a personal access token to
# ensure that the PR gets CI triggered on it. Additionally the commit message
# is specifically worded to get recognized by `push-tag.yml`.

          This is an automated pull request from CI which is intended to
          notify maintainers that it's time to release Wasmtime version
          ${{ steps.bump.outputs.version }}. Version numbers have been bumped
          in this PR automatically and the release process will automatically
          enter the next stages once this PR is merged.

          It's recommended that maintainers double-check that [RELEASES.md]
          is up-to-date. If not please feel free to push to this PR any
          modifications to the release notes. Additionally before merging it's
          probably best to double-check the [release process] and make sure that
          everything is ship-shape.
